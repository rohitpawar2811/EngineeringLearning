## Conditional sentences,
 also known as conditional clauses or if-clauses, express hypothetical situations and their possible outcomes. They consist of two main parts: the "if" clause (the condition) and the main clause (the result). There are several different forms of conditional sentences in English, each expressing a different level of certainty or likelihood of the condition being met and its consequence occurring. The most common types are:

1. **Zero Conditional (Present Real Conditional):**
   - Form: If + present simple, present simple
   - Example: If you heat water to 100 degrees Celsius, it boils.
   - Usage: Used to describe facts or general truths.

2. **First Conditional (Present or Future Real Conditional):**
   - Form: If + present simple, will + base form of the verb
   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, I will bring an umbrella.
   - Usage: Used to talk about possible events or outcomes in the future.

3. **Second Conditional (Present Unreal Conditional):**
   - Form: If + past simple, would + base form of the verb
   - Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a yacht.
   - Usage: Used to express hypothetical situations in the present or future that are unlikely or contrary to fact.

4. **Third Conditional (Past Unreal Conditional):**
   - Form: If + past perfect, would have + past participle
   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.
   - Usage: Used to express hypothetical situations in the past that did not happen.

5. **Mixed Conditional:**
   - Form: Combines elements of the second and third conditionals, mixing tenses from different conditional types.
   - Example: If I had known you were coming, I would have baked a cake.
   - Usage: Used to express hypothetical situations where the condition is in the past and the consequence is in the present or vice versa.

Rules for conditional sentences:
- The order of the clauses can be reversed without changing the meaning, but if the if-clause comes second, no comma is needed.
- In the if-clause, you can use modals like can, may, might, etc., to indicate possibility or permission.
- Sometimes "unless" can be used instead of "if not" in conditional sentences.
- In the zero conditional, when the condition and result are always true, you can use "when" instead of "if".
- In the first conditional, "will" can be replaced with other modals like "can", "may", or "might" to indicate varying levels of certainty.
- In the second and third conditionals, "would" can be replaced with other modals like "could", "should", or "might" to indicate varying degrees of hypothetical outcomes.

Understanding and correctly using conditional sentences is important in English grammar as it allows speakers to express possibilities, hypothetical situations, and consequences effectively.

## English Concept

1. Said vs told -> we have to use `told` only when you get direct speech to you. but when sack of pepole directed then we have to use `said`.

2. When To use `Would` -> when you requesting someone you have to use this, 


## See VS WATCH

Use "see" when referring to the act of perceiving something with your eyes or being aware of something visually without necessarily focusing your attention on it actively.
Example: "I saw a beautiful sunset."
"See" is also used when talking about events, shows, or performances in a general sense without implying active attention or focus.
Example: "I saw the concert last night."
Watch:

Use "watch" when describing the intentional act of observing something with focused attention, typically for a period of time.
Example: "I watched a movie last night."
"Watch" is also used when referring to observing ongoing actions or events.
Example: "Let's watch the game together."

### Model Verbs

It seems like you're referring to "modal verbs." Modal verbs are a type of auxiliary verb used to express modality—that is, to convey the attitude, possibility, necessity, or permission of the action or state expressed by the main verb in a sentence. In English, common modal verbs include "can," "could," "may," "might," "will," "would," "shall," "should," "must," "ought to," and "need to."

For example:

I can swim.
She may arrive late.
You should study for the exam.
He must finish his homework.
