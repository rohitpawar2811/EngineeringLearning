# Share Market

IPO: Intial public offering, where a compony release itself to open and list in NSE or BSE so that other person can buy/sell the shares. There were some intial fixed prize at which IPO launched.

## Exchange NSE, BSE : 
where buy and sell , bit and ask where maintained

## Liquidity: 
Buyer and seller transaction exchnage is called liquidity exchange.

A stock’s liquidity generally refers to how rapidly shares of a stock can be bought or sold without substantially impacting the stock price. Stocks with low liquidity may be difficult to sell and may cause you to take a bigger loss if you cannot sell the shares when you want to.

Liquidity risk is the risk that investors won’t find a market for their securities, which may prevent them from buying or selling when they want. This is sometimes the case with complicated investment products and products that charge a penalty for early withdrawal or liquidation such as a certificate of deposit (CD).

 ## Bid: 1000 , Ask: 1005 and the diffrence b/w them was spread.
and the spread less is profitable. Like nifity.
 spread:5 

## Stock Options Trade

Nifity and Bank nifity Option trade : In this liquidity is more and spread is much less that bid and ask diffrence is to much less.

## ITC, HDFC, Havens: F&O  
Option trade and getting profit and he tried to **market order** and tried to square of the position .

but he got into loss because of less liquidity where the seller ask only buy in 92. means market rate changed suddenly

## ITs risky to deal with less liquidity stokes : you should not deal with them,

we only deal with the stokes and there options where liquidity is more.

Commidity Market : where oil,gold and etc things


## Compony Listed is NSE and BSE ?

ETF:Exchange TRADED FUND => MF(mutual funds)

ETF companys: 
1. Nifty 
2. Gold
3. USCompny funds

Virtual and Pysical gold both rate are some , you have to pay the gst.
but there is another option which is **GOLD BOND** - -

- Benefit is that you are getting 10% extra interest.
- Disadv but in Bonds you gone in a lock in period for fixed period of time.
- For long term holding this might be a good option like sovereign gold bonds


## ETF:
- no gst , no making charges,less variation
- ETF is a group of company min 10 which has high movementum in terms of growth.

- Investment never being objective it is always subjective.

SmallCaps ETF : if nifity goes down then smallcaps one also.

Nifty always have top 50 big company : and it is always like elefant stable and slight of slow.

## Investment and trading are two things
 Investment never thing about selling , and don't think about the time period.

 trading : here you think about selling and you want to buy and sell


## There is always risk that market crash 

## Best Invetment Streatgy

1. Averging : when ever stokcs down again buy and buy that called averging . but it can be lossy as it can go down as to much .

100(1l)->90(1l)-> 80 :Loss


2. Goverment Security : when you want to invest for short duration is less 1y,2y you got some interest surely like 10%

Market  = 1/goverment-security and gold
invertionly propotional 
and sure to get inflation 10%

## Option Trading

It is like beating. you will get **call** and **put** option Here.

Generally senerio of option is like insurance like if you invested about 10L in shares and shares goes down about 10% you lose 1L, Here you can buy put option (50K something prize) and here if market goes down you get paid for that.

But now other traders are using it for betting. They will bet either market is going down or up.

And the Betting has 2 Participants

1. Seller : who is allowing you to get call and put option on a certion price (in another words it is the Insurance owners).
2. Buyer : who will pay for call and put. and if situation gots in favour get paid with high amount.

Generally In seller and buyer profit ratio 60:30 parcent. because seller also predict what is happening in the market and according to that he will fix price of **call and put**.

Here in Option trading anyday anyone can opt-out from the trade. but what bet you took you have to sell and for that you need a buyer and here comes liquidity (if you are trading with shares where liquidity is more then it so much easy).

theta-decay: when the event or bet expiration time comes close seller will make prize high or less according his favored bet condition

Here we can get many if bet price getting higher that means seller don't want us to buy and the share market is going up.


## BreakEven price You should know :
 like you had bet that if it reached 100 more then you can get varible pay 1 rupee but for that that bet you paid 10 repee than your breakEven is 110, after this amount you will get profit.

Limit: you can limit on the buy, if that limit will come only then your order will execute, otherwise you can buy at the market price.

## market goes in up : 
buy call option , sell put option
## market goes down :
 buy put option , sell call option

## Options:
Nifity CE

Nifity PE 

This are the seprate category where you can make bets
Conditions: 

- You can buy in loats only. like 50,60,100 something
- Primium got increased when the event look like feasible


## Intraday allows you to short sell

1. Short sell means that you can sell shares before buying them. In this case margin amount will be on hold till the position is squared off.

2. Intraday let’s you buy a stock “on margin”.
      If the margin is 20%, you can buy 5x shares for the same amount.
      Hence trading on margin magnifies not just profits but also losses by 5x.

3. Intraday orders get squared off when the market closes. Which means a buy/sell position opened during the day is reversed (sell/buy) before the market closes.
You can place these orders on margin i.e. you pay fraction of the total price. But it is risky.

ETF will give you profit in long term 

propation and percent wise averging streategy when the stock prise goes down.
we have to always buy as it is sure it will go at the end.
