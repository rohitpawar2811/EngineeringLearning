#Vue JS Learnings

Why Learn Vue?
    - It is simple and easy to use.
    - It is able to handle both simple and complex projects.
    - Its growing popularity and open-source community support.
    - In normal JavaScript we need to write HOW HTML and JavaScript is connected, but in Vue we simply need to make sure that there IS a connection and let Vue take care of the rest.
    - It allows for a more efficient development process with a template-based syntax, two-way data binding, and a centralized state management.
