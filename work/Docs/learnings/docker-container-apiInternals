# Docker-API Internals

Docker is using different container runtime which container-io , and the kubernetes is using cri-io as runtime , so images pulled by kubernets would not be visible in the docker
so I have to use
sudo crictl images

when you mean 'show up on the VM' do you mean by running 'docker image ls' ? if so, that's probably because kubernetes is using a different container driver. Docker is only one way of interacting with containers, it's the most famous and real hardcore container linux people hate docker because docker is a company and it has its own agenda. I think kubernetes is using CRI-O as the default container runtime now, try running crictl images to see the images that kubernetes pulls
