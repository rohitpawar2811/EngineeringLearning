## Impetus

1. Solid what is l here.
2. Access Modifiers which access modifier has the greater visibility Default, Protected?
3. throw vs Throws
4. Compile Time and runtime Exception
5. HashMap vs HashSet internal implication
6. HashMap store the Null while TreeMap not why because of key sorting.
7. can we change the access modifier of an varible by inheriting it.
8. While performing inheritance we are overiding an method in subclass can we change its return type in subclass
Answer : Only if return type are related to each other.
No, it will not work. In Java, if you override a method in a subclass, the return type of the overridden method must be either the same as the method in the superclass or a subtype (covariant return type) of the return type in the superclass.

class Animal {
    Animal getAnimal() {
        return this;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    Dog getAnimal() { // Covariant return type: Dog is a subclass of Animal
        return this;
    }
}

9. HashMap store distinct element how can it verify because in case of collition there would be multiple different key stored at the same place.

class Employee {
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Employee employee = (Employee) o;
        return name.equals(employee.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return name.hashCode();
    }
}

9. What if we create a custom object of employee class emp1, emp2 and make them as Key in hashMap and emp1 and emp2 has name attribute that store same name , both object treated as different in the HashMap?

By default, if you do not override the hashCode() and equals() methods in your Employee class, the HashMap will treat emp1 and emp2 as different keys, even if their name attributes are the same. This is because the default implementations of hashCode() and equals() in the Object class behave as follows:

10. Equals method in String class.

11. Spark vs Hadoop
12. Spark vs Hadoop vs Reduce vs Apache Hadoop
13. Spark RDD
14. Hands on Program to read the data and spark connection , read csv , filter emp with greater >1000, and then collect all those employee.
Here we can we use DF, But we have to do with rdd. -> in csv rdd we got the line we have to split by using map and then filter out those employee information 

15. How can we retrive the corrupted RDD in spark.
17. How can we detect the slow job in spark.

from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext

-> Step 1: Initialize Spark context
conf = SparkConf().setAppName("EmployeeFilter").setMaster("local")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

-> Step 2: Read the CSV file as an RDD
lines = sc.textFile("path/to/employee.csv")

-> Step 3: Split each line by comma and map to a list of strings
employees = lines.map(lambda line: line.split(","))

// Assuming the CSV has the following format: ID, Name, Salary
// Salary is at index 2 in the list

-> Step 4: Filter employees with salary > 1000
filtered_employees = employees.filter(lambda emp: float(emp[2]) > 1000)

-> Step 5: Collect the filtered employees
result = filtered_employees.collect()

-> Print the results
for emp in result:
    print(f"ID: {emp[0]}, Name: {emp[1]}, Salary: {emp[2]}")

-> Stop the Spark context
sc.stop()

## Walmart Global Tech Coding round

1. Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
 
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
 
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
 
Example 1:
 
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
 
 
 
Example 2:
 
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
