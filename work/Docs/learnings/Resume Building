Hotwax OMS: 

- Integrated Azure-Saml-Single-Sign-On at Steve-Madden OMS apps using APIs and also gives the flexibility to assign permission directly from azure-side, delivered single handed and take it to production

- Migrated Solr standalone services and api to Solr-cloud and with including backward compatibility.

- Integrated Central Logout Mechanism as there are variety of commerce apps which is used by clients, and as we provided sso support so Central Logout Mechanism must be Integrated.

- Embedded Superset Dashboards in Oms, as there is security concern in direct exposing of production superset.

- Implemented api for Proxy superset request, which is previously directly communicated throw Solr, but now superset connects with OMS and oms API proxy that requests to preferred solr, advantage security enhancement, we don't have to expose solr on superset.

- Design Apache Solr schema for monitoring the import product jobs which is a batch job , but because of some misconfiguration some products are not imported so we would index in collection logs-insights and query on that from superset which provides real-time dashboarding of non-imported products

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotwax OMS Achievements:

- Successfully integrated Azure-SAML-Single-Sign-On into Steve-Madden OMS applications via APIs, providing the added flexibility of assigning permissions directly from the Azure side. Executed the integration independently and ensured its seamless transition to production.

- Led the migration of Solr standalone services and APIs to Solr-cloud, incorporating backward compatibility to make sure old things not break and ensured its performance and scalability.

- Implemented a Central Logout Mechanism to address the diverse array of commerce applications used by clients. This mechanism seamlessly integrates with the Single Sign-On support, offering a unified solution for secure user logout.

- Implemented code to Embed the Apache superset Dashboard in HotwaxOMS, while doing so make sure about superset-permission, about different brands.This strategic measure safeguards sensitive production Superset data from direct exposure.

- Developed proxy API Superset requests, re-routing communication from Solr to OMS. This enhanced security by eliminating the need to expose Solr directly on Superset. The updated architecture ensures a more secure and efficient communication flow.

- Designed the Apache Solr schema to monitor the import progress of product batch jobs. Recognizing the challenges posed by misconfigurations that hindered product imports, the solution involved indexing in the "logs-insights" collection. Leveraging Superset, real-time dashboards were created to track and visualize non-imported products, providing valuable insights for prompt issue resolution.

- Researched and Implemented Multi-Instance Environment setup from one place. which make it easy to push the images on remote location and deploy the application on docker using docker api and same Aws Ec2. Totatly It make easy deployments for BA.
